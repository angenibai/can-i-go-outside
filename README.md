# Can I Go Outside?
Official advice for your DMS :)

This messenger bot tells the user where they can go, and what regulations they need to follow.

This was developed for the 2020 CSESoc Hackathon by Ada Luong, Angeni Bai, Edwina Adisusila, Giuliana de Bellis and Ingrid Norton.

## Technologies
- Facebook API
- WIT.ai Natural Language Processing
- Hosting on Heroku --> future deployment on AWS as userbase increases

## Business viability
The low costs associated with hosting this bot can be covered either by:
- Partnering with governments, as this bot helps governments ensure that coronavirus restrictions are being followed
- Running Messenger ads within the bot for personal protection equipment such as hand sanitizer
