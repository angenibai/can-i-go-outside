# Can I Go Outside?
A Messenger chat bot that informs people whether or not they can go outside, based on current government restrictions.

## A guide to making changes and testing lol

### Experimenting/fun coding 
**Clone the repo locally**

Create a directory and navigate to it. Then type in
```shell
git clone https://github.com/angenibai/can-i-go-out-side.git
```
**Create a branch with your name**
```shell
git branch andre
```
**Navigate to your branch**
```shell
git checkout andre
```
**Stage all your changes**
```shell
git add .
```
**Commit these changes with a message**
```shell
git commit -m 'great message !'
```
### Publishing for testing !
**PLEASE PULL FIRST TO UPDATE WITH THE ORIGIN**
```shell
git pull
```
Idk if you're supposed to do this but **add** and **commit** again just to be safe.

**Push to origin**
```shell
git push
```
If there's any errors here, just do what the terminal tells you to do.

Open up the repo in your browser and make a new **pull request** to the **dev** branch.

**Resolve any conflicts and merge**

Should be good to test from here :)
### Getting back into coding
**Make sure you're on your own branch**
```shell
git checkout andre
```
**Pull to make sure you're up to date**
```shell
git pull
```
I think you might also want to get onto the online repo and **merge** from **master** or **master** (up to you what version you'd like to work on)

Now code away !
### Committing to master
If you're pretty confident your code is working, do all the steps as before, but now submit a pull request to **master**.
